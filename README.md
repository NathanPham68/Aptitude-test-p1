## Q1: Two buses collided on the Vietnam–China border. The passengers were tourists from all five continents (America, Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa). After the accident, in which country should the survivors be buried?  

a) Vietnam  
b) China  
c) Each person should be buried in their home country  
d) They should not be buried anywhere  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**

## Q2: There are 4 mangoes on the table. You take away 3. How many mangoes do you have now?  

a) 1  
b) 2  
c) 3  
d) 4  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
The trick here is in the wording: *you take away 3 mangoes* → those 3 mangoes are now **yours**.  
So you have **3**, not 1 (remaining on the table).  

✅ Correct Answer: **c) 3**

## Q3: If "OCNG" corresponds to the word "CONG" and "IVEN" corresponds to "VIEN", then which of the following corresponds to "NUOC":  

a) NOCU  
b) UNOC  
c) OUNC  
d) CONU

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Rule observed from the examples: **swap the first two letters**, leaving the rest in the same order.  
- CONG → OCNG (C and O swapped)  
- VIEN → IVEN (V and I swapped)  

Apply the same rule to NUOC (N U O C): swap the first two letters → U N O C → **UNOC**.

✅ **Correct answer: b) UNOC**

---

## Q4: If the word "Past" corresponds to "Present", then the word "Before / Previously" corresponds to:

a) Here  
b) Today  
c) Now  
d) Yesterday  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
"Quá khứ" = Past and "Hiện tại" = Present — they are opposites. "Trước đây" is a synonym of Past, so its corresponding term should be a synonym of Present.
Among the choices, "Bây giờ" (Now / Present) is the direct match.

✅ **Correct answer: c) Now**

## Q5: Is the following statement logical? "If a man in Saigon marries the younger sister of his widow"  

a) Logical  
b) Not logical  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**   
If his wife is a **widow**, it means her husband (the man) is already dead.  
A dead man cannot marry anyone.  
Therefore, the statement is self-contradictory.  

✅ **Correct answer: b) Not logical**

- 5 → 10 (+5)  
- 10 → 16 (+6)  
- 16 → 23 (+7)  
- 23 → ? (+8) = 31  

So the missing number is **31**.  

✅ **Correct answer: d) 31**

---

## Q7: On average, how many birthdays does a person have?  

a) At least 1  
b) More than 2  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**

## Q8: November 20th is Vietnam’s Teachers’ Day. Does the United States also have a November 20th?  

a) Yes  
b) No  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Every country follows the same international calendar, so the **date November 20th exists in the U.S. as well**.  
The difference is in the **meaning**: in Vietnam it is Teachers’ Day, in the U.S. it is just a regular date.  

✅ **Correct answer: a) Yes**

## Q11: A class has twice as many boys as girls. All the boys have black hair, and only half of the girls have black hair. Five female students do **not** have black hair. How many students are in the class?  

a) 15  
b) 20  
c) 30  
d) 35

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Let the number of girls be \(G\).  
- Number of boys = \(2G\).  
- "Only half of the girls have black hair" ⇒ half of the girls **do not** have black hair as well.  
- The number of girls without black hair = \(G/2\), and we are told this equals 5.  
So \(G/2 = 5 ⇒ G = 10\).  
Boys = \(2G = 20\).  
Total students = \(G + 2G = 3G = 30\).

✅ **Correct answer: c) 30**

---

## Q12: In one year, some months have 31 days, others have 30 days. How many months have **28 days**?  

a) 1  
b) 4  
c) 8  
d) 12  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Every month has **at least 28 days**.

## Q13: Two boxes are placed inside one big box, and each of those boxes contains three smaller boxes inside. How many boxes are there in total?  

a) 9  
b) 8  
c) 7  
d) 5  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
- 1 big box  
- Inside it, 2 boxes  
- Each of the 2 boxes contains 3 smaller boxes ⇒ \(2 × 3 = 6\) small boxes  

Total boxes = \(1 + 2 + 6 = 9\).  

✅ **Correct answer: a) 9**

---

## Q14: Linh is the 3rd student in a line. The number of students standing **behind** Linh is **twice** the number of students standing **in front of** Linh. What is the total number of students in the line?  

a) 8  
b) 6  
c) 7  
d) 5  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
- Linh is **3rd** → there are **2 students in front**.  
- Students behind = \(2 × 2 = 4\).  
- Total students = in front (2) + Linh (1) + behind (4) = **7**.  

✅ **Correct answer: c) 7**

## Q15: You have the following denominations: 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50. Which of the following amounts requires the **largest number of banknotes** to pay, assuming you must use **at least one of each denomination**?  

a) 19  
b) 43  
c) 61  
d) 99  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
- If we must use at least one of each (2 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 50), the minimum total already = **87**.  
- Therefore, amounts less than 87 (19, 43, 61) are **impossible** to pay under this rule.  
- For 99:  
  - Start with 87 (using 1 of each note).  
  - Need 12 more → 10 + 2.  
  - That means adding 2 more notes.  
  - Total notes = 5 (base set) + 2 = **7 notes**.  

✅ **Correct answer: d) 99**

## Q16: In Hanoi, 80% of households have a TV and 40% have a motorbike. Which of the following statements is correct?  

a) At least half of the households with a TV also have a motorbike  
b) All households have either a TV or a motorbike  
c) One-fifth of households either don’t have a TV or don’t have a motorbike  
d) At least one-fifth of households have both a TV and a motorbike  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Let’s denote:  
- \(T = 80\%\) households have a TV  
- \(M = 40\%\) households have a motorbike  

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  
\[
P(T \cap M) \geq P(T) + P(M) - 100\% = 80\% + 40\% - 100\% = 20\%.
\]

So **at least 20% of households have both a TV and a motorbike**.  

Now check options:  
- (a) Not necessarily true. 40% total have motorbikes, but not guaranteed half of TV owners.  
- (b) False, since maximum union is \(80\% + 40\% = 120\%\), but could be only 80% if all motorbike owners are also TV owners. So not guaranteed.  
- (c) Wrong, because “at least 20% have both” doesn’t imply “only one-fifth without TV or bike.”  
- (d) Correct, since we just proved **≥ 20% (1/5)** have both.  

✅ **Correct answer: d) At least one-fifth of households have both a TV and a motorbike**

## Q17: The sum of two numbers is 90, and the difference between them is 34. What is the larger number?  

a) 28  
b) 48  
c) 52  
d) 62  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Let the two numbers be \(x\) (larger) and \(y\) (smaller).  

We have:  
\[
x + y = 90
\]  
\[
x - y = 34
\]  

Add the two equations:  
\[
2x = 124 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 62
\]  

So the larger number is **62**.  

✅ **Correct answer: d) 62**

---

## Q18: An officer’s salary is 10,800 USD per year, but he only receives 700 USD per month after tax. How much tax does he pay each month?  

a) 200  
b) 24,000  
c) 240  
d) 10,100  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
- Annual salary = 10,800 USD  
- Monthly salary before tax = \(10,800 / 12 = 900\) USD  
- He receives 700 USD after tax  
- Tax per month = \(900 - 700 = 200\) USD  

✅ **Correct answer: a) 200**

## Q19: 12 wooden stakes are used to mark a square plot of land, with each stake placed 2 meters apart. What is the area of the land?  

a) 12 m²  
b) 18 m²  
c) 36 m²  
d) 24 m²  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
We have 12 stakes around a square, each 2m apart. That means the **perimeter** is:  
\[
11 \times 2 = 22 \, \text{m}
\]  
(because 12 stakes make 11 gaps around the square).  

But since the figure must be a closed square, the perimeter should be divisible by 4. Let’s check carefully:  

- For a square with side length \(L\), the number of stakes = 4 sides × (stakes per side).  
- If each side length = \(6\) m, then each side has \(L / 2 = 3\) gaps → 4 stakes per side.  
- With overlaps at corners, total stakes = \(4 \times 3 = 12\).  

So side length = \(6\) m.  

Area = \(6 \times 6 = 36 \, m^2\).  

✅ **Correct answer: c) 36 m²**

## Q20: If the code "CPNRYW" corresponds to "Colour" and "TFNHZNYPWW" corresponds to "Television", then which code corresponds to "Set"?  

a) SFV  
b) SFU  
c) SEU  
d) SER

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Observed rule: each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by an increasing amount according to its position (1st letter +0, 2nd +1, 3rd +2, ...).

Apply to **SET**:  
- 1st letter: **S** + 0 → **S**  
- 2nd letter: **E** + 1 → **F**  
- 3rd letter: **T** + 2 → **V**  (T → U → V)

So the encoded result is **SFV**.

✅ **Correct answer: a) SFV**

---

## Q21: If the code "TMCDQ" corresponds to the word "under" and "GNTRD" corresponds to "House", then which code corresponds to "arrest":  

a) BSSDTR  
b) BSSFTV  
c) BQQFRS  
d) ZSSFTS  
e) ZQQDRS

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Observe the mapping: each plaintext letter is shifted **backward by 1** in the alphabet and then written in **uppercase**.  
Examples:  
- under → u→T (u-1 = t → T), n→M, d→C, e→D, r→Q ⇒ **TMCDQ**  
- House → h→G, o→N, u→T, s→R, e→D ⇒ **GNTRD**

Apply the same rule to **arrest**:  
- a → previous letter = z → **Z**  
- r → q → **Q**  
- r → q → **Q**  
- e → d → **D**  
- s → r → **R**  
- t → s → **S**

Encoded result: **ZQQDRS**

✅ **Correct answer: e) ZQQDRS**

---

## Q22: If we double a number, then divide it by 3, and finally add 7, we get 23. What is that number?  
a) 16  
b) 34  
c) 20  
d) 24  

**👉🏼 Answer & Explanation:**  
Let the number be \(x\).  
\[
\frac{2x}{3} + 7 = 23
\]  
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 16
\]  
\[
2x = 48
\]  
\[
x = 24
\]  

✅ **Correct answer: d) 24**
